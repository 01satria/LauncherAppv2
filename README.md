## Why Satria Launcher?

Most launchers are either cluttered with features you'll never use, or so minimal they're useless. Satria Launcher sits in the sweet spot, a clean home screen with a quiet set of tools ready when you actually need them.

- **Transparent background** — your wallpaper is the design
- **Blazing fast** — lightweight and smooth on any device
- **No bloat** — every feature earns its place

## Features

### 🏠 Home Screen
Grid or list layout, toggle app names on/off, hide apps you don't want cluttering your drawer. Long press any app for quick actions such as pin, hide, or uninstall without ever leaving the home screen.

In **Grid mode**, apps are organized into pages you swipe left and right — just like iOS or One UI. A page indicator appears above the Brief pill so you always know which page you're on. The number of columns and rows per page is fully customizable from Settings.

### 📌 Dock
Pin up to 4 favorite apps for instant access. Your avatar lives here too, tap to open the Dashboard, long press for Settings.

### 🧩 Home Widgets
Add widgets directly to your home screen to glance at live information without opening anything. Three widgets are available: **Clock** (large time + date display), **Date** (calendar-style day card), and **Battery** (live charge level with a color-coded bar that turns red when low and green while charging).

### 💬 Chat
A lightweight personal assistant that knows your name, greets you by time of day, and keeps your conversation alive throughout the session.

### 🌤️ Weather
Realtime weather for any city in the world, no account, no API key, completely free. Save up to 8 locations and check an hourly forecast for the rest of the day.

### 💱 Currency
Live exchange rates for 14 currencies including USD, EUR, IDR, GBP, JPY, CNY, SGD, AUD, KRW, MYR, THB, INR, SAR, and AED. Convert instantly, anytime.

### 📝 To-Do
A minimal task list that remembers everything. Check things off with a satisfying animated tick. No accounts, no sync, no nonsense.

### ⏳ Countdown
Track what matters like birthdays, deadlines, trips. Color coded so you always know how close you are.

### 🍅 Pomodoro
A fullscreen focus timer built around the Pomodoro technique. Set your own work duration (not locked to 25 minutes), watch the circular progress arc count down, and let the screen stay on automatically while you focus. An ambient clock is shown throughout so you never lose track of time.

### 🧮 Calculator
A built-in calculator that handles everyday arithmetic with no internet required. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with a clean, tap-friendly button layout.

### ⏱️ Stopwatch & Timer
A dual-purpose time tool. The **Stopwatch** records lap splits in a scrollable list displayed above the controls, so you can compare all your times at a glance without anything being hidden behind the interface. The **Timer** lets you set any countdown duration and alerts you when time is up.

### 🗒️ Notes
Jot down anything quickly. Notes are saved locally with a timestamp. Tap any note to edit or delete it. The Dashboard badge shows how many notes you have at a glance.

### 📐 Unit Converter
Offline conversion across six categories with no network needed: **Length** (km, miles, feet, inches, cm, mm, yards, nautical miles), **Weight** (kg, lbs, g, oz, tonnes, stones), **Temperature** (°C, °F, K), **Speed** (km/h, mph, m/s, knots), **Volume** (liters, gallons, ml, fluid oz, cups, pints, quarts), and **Area** (m², km², ft², acres, hectares).

### 💪 Habits
Build streaks that stick. Add daily habits, tap to mark them done, and watch a 🔥 streak counter grow with each consecutive day. The Dashboard shows your progress at a glance with a live completion badge.
