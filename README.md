## Why Satria Launcher?

Most launchers are either cluttered with features you'll never use, or so minimal they're useless. Satria Launcher sits in the sweet spot, a clean home screen with a quiet set of tools ready when you actually need them.

- **Transparent background** — your wallpaper is the design
- **Blazing fast** — lightweight and smooth on any device
- **No bloat** — every feature earns its place
